<h2>TASK 1</h2>
<h1>Prediction Using Supervised Model</h1>

Simple Linear Regression
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?



<h2>TASK 7</h2>

<h1>Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis</h1>

<p>This project aimed to analyze stock prices using historical data from the S&P BSE SENSEX index and news headlines. The news data was collected and preprocessed to extract sentiment information using text analysis techniques

The stock data was also collected and preprocessed, and an ARIMA model was used to make predictions on the stock prices.

Both the news and stock data were then combined and used to train and test various machine learning models including LSTM, XGBoost, and Random Forest. The performance of these models was evaluated by comparing their mean squared error on the test data.

Ultimately, the LSTM model performed the best with the lowest mean squared error. The project demonstrates how incorporating sentiment analysis from news headlines can aid in the prediction of stock prices.<p>
